<p>In order to provide access to its collections, the George Eastman Museum makes available many of these objects to recognized institutions and exhibition agencies, such as libraries and museums, which have established exhibition programs, an acceptable physical environment, and a full–time professional staff proficient in handling the particular material requested. Each request for loan will be judged on its particular merits—the type of institution, the program, and the exhibition for which the loan is proposed in relation to the importance, stability, uniqueness, and value (both monetary and intrinsic) of the material being requested.</p>
